# Dynamic Forms

This example shows how metadata drives the creation of form fields. A collection
contains the label, HTML input type, and model property name for each field. The
component iterates over this collection and uses `DynamicComponent` to render the
inputs inside an `EditForm`. An `EditContext` binds the fields to the model, and
submitted values are displayed below the form.
